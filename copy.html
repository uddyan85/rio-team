                    While copyright protects your original content, it doesn't necessarily protect your business idea.
                    If you have a unique concept for connecting employers with non-degreed candidates, consider
                    trademarking your brand name or logo. <br> 
                    It's always a good idea to consult with a lawyer to ensure your website's legal compliance,
                    especially if you plan to expand your services or operate in a specific industry.
